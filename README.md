# FDFD.jl

!(img/coupler_fields.png)

FDFD.jl is a 2D finite difference frequency domain (FDFD) code written in Julia for solving Maxwell's equations. 

## Usage
Please see the included [Examples_FDFD_jl.ipyn](Examples_FDFD_jl.ipynb) Jupyter notebook for some barebones examples.

## Credits
Credit for the FDFD algorithm goes to Jerry Shi and Wonseok Shin from Shanhui Fan's [research group](http://web.stanford.edu/group/fan/) at Stanford University. There are two MATLAB implementations of FDFD available which are likely to be more functional than the code provided here and there is also a work-in-progress FDFD Julia package being developed. See below for links to these projects.
