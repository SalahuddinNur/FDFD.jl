# FDFD.jl

## About
This is a 2D finite difference frequency domain (FDFD) code for optical and electromagnetic systems written in Julia.

## Credit
Credit for the FDFD algorithm goes to Jerry Shi and Wonseok Shin, both of the Fan group at Stanford. There are two MATLAB implementations of FDFD available, both of which are likely to be more functional than this package.
